# Homelab Infrastructure üöÄ

A collection of Ansible, Packer, and Terraform configurations for provisioning and managing a home lab environment on Proxmox VE. This setup automates the creation of VM templates, spins up VMs, configures Kubernetes clusters, and streamlines system administration tasks.

## Overview üèóÔ∏è

This repository aims to automate the end-to-end workflow of provisioning and managing a homelab environment. Using **Packer** üè≠, you can build ready-to-use VM templates for Proxmox. Then, leverage **Terraform** üåç to stand up VMs and Kubernetes clusters quickly and consistently. Finally, use **Ansible** ‚öôÔ∏è to configure and maintain services and applications (e.g., NFS servers, monitoring stacks, Vault, etc.) across your infrastructure.

Key goals:

- **Consistency** üìå: Deploy the same base images, configurations, and services every time.
- **Scalability** üìà: Easily add new VMs or clusters without manual setup.
- **Modularity** üß©: Focus on self-contained modules, roles, and tasks that can be reused and extended.
- **Security** üîê: Use standardized images, enforce configuration best practices, and manage secrets properly.

## Requirements ‚öôÔ∏è

1. **Proxmox VE** üñ•Ô∏è environment where VMs will be created and managed.
2. **Terraform** (‚â• 1.x) üèóÔ∏è and the [Proxmox Provider (bpg/proxmox)](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/bpg/proxmox/latest).
3. **Packer** CLI üè≠ for building VM templates.
4. **Ansible** (‚â• 2.9) ‚öôÔ∏è for post-deployment configuration and ongoing management.
5. **Valid Proxmox API token** üîë with adequate permissions to clone templates and manage VMs.

## Usage üöÄ

### 1. Packer Templates üè≠

1. **Navigate to the `packer/` directory** (or specific sub-folder):
   ```bash
   cd packer/1000-pkr-rocky9-ks
   ```
2. **Initialize Packer** (if needed):
   ```bash
   packer init .
   ```
3. **Build a template**:
   ```bash
   packer build -var-file=../secret.json builder.pkr.hcl
   ```
   - `secret.json` includes your Proxmox API credentials and other sensitive information (not committed to version control).
4. **Result**: A new VM template is created in Proxmox, ready for cloning.

### 2. Terraform Provisioning üåç

1. **Go to the `terraform/` directory**:
   ```bash
   cd terraform
   ```
2. **Initialize Terraform**:
   ```bash
   terraform init
   ```
3. **Set/verify your variables** (e.g., `terraform.tfvars` or environment variables):
   ```hcl
   proxmox_apitoken  = "bpg/proxmox"
   proxmox_endpoint  = "https://your-proxmox:8006/api2/json"
   ansible_path      = "/path/to/your/ansible/inventory"
   # etc.
   ```
4. **Plan your changes**:
   ```bash
   terraform plan
   ```
5. **Apply**:
   ```bash
   terraform apply
   ```
   - This will create (or update) your VMs, Kubernetes clusters, etc.
6. **Destroy** (if needed):
   ```bash
   terraform destroy
   ```

### 3. Ansible Configuration ‚öôÔ∏è

1. **Inventory** üìã: The Terraform modules (like `aggregator`) can write inventory data for Ansible. Alternatively, maintain a dedicated inventory file in `ansible/inventories`.
2. **Roles**:
   - Each directory under `ansible/roles/` houses tasks, defaults, handlers, templates, etc., for a given service:
     - `clamav` üõ°Ô∏è: Anti-virus scanning.
     - `common` üèóÔ∏è: Common tasks for all servers (user setup, package updates).
     - `grafana` üìä: Install and configure Grafana for monitoring dashboards.
     - `prometheus`, `node_exporter`, `promtail_agent`, `loki` üîç: Monitoring and log-aggregation stack roles.
     - `vault`, `wazuh`, `stepca` üîê: Security, intrusion detection, and PKI services.
     - And more...
3. **Playbooks**:
   - Create or use an existing playbook (e.g., `ansible/playbooks/site.yml`) to orchestrate role execution across hosts.

Example usage:

```bash
cd ansible
ansible-playbook -i inventories/hosts playbooks/site.yml
```
